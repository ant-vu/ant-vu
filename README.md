I am a full-time Software Developer at Citigroup and graduated from McMaster Universityâ€™s Computer Science Co-op program with a 3.97 CGPA.

With over two years of professional experience across multiple firms, I come with a unique blend of technical expertise and passion to pick up anything and run with it.
